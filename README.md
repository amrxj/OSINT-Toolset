slowly developing what was once a tool for geolocation via EXIF information from images, to a full-fledged OSINT tool to understand and implement various tools & methods. 
goals so far: 
- fix this geolocation (it shat itself)
- add more tools (but not simply tossing them in you know, understand how they work, code 'em, and then implement.)
- maybe have a cleaner CLI experience.
